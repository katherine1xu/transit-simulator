### What Branches The Refactors Are In

#### Refactor 1 for Iteration 2

For this refactor, I had made changes that would change the probability of the
last stop to zero. I made this refactor in my **refactor/iter2** branch.

#### Refactor 2 for Iteration 3

For this refactor, I made changes so that the method names were improved and
were better for understanding the function of the method for functions in the
Bus and Stop classes. I did this refactor in my **refactor/iter3** branch.

### Other Assumptions

1. When executing the vis_sim that resides in the /build/bin/ directory, the user
must execute it from the project directory. The user cannot **cd** to bin/
and run `./vis_sim <port_number>`. The user must navigate to the base project
directory (project/) to be able to execute.

2. When executing the config_sim that resides in the /build/bin/ directory, the
user must execute it from the project directory. The user cannot **cd** to bin/
and run `./config_sim`. The user must navigate to the base project directory
(project/) to be able to execute.
